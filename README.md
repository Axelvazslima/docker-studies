# Docker Studies üê≥

A personal repository dedicated to exploring Docker and containerization concepts. This repository will serve as a comprehensive resource for my learning journey, documenting hands-on projects, key insights, and experimentations with Docker. It is open for anyone to access and learn from, contributing to a shared understanding of containerized environments.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Docker on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.
    - If you haven't installed Docker yet, follow the official installation guide for your operating system:
        - [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Basic understanding of terminal/command line operations.
    - To know more about it, check the [useful links](#-credits-and-useful-links) section.

### üñ•Ô∏è Installing WSL for a Better Development Environment

To enhance your Docker experience on Windows, it‚Äôs recommended to use **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)**. It provides a full Linux kernel, improving performance and compatibility with Docker and other Linux-based tools.

### Steps to Install WSL:

1. **Enable WSL and Virtual Machine Platform**:

   Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
`bash`

2.  **Install WSL**

    `wsl --install -d ubuntu`

    It installs the ubuntu version, the most famous and it's easy to use.

3. Now, **set WSL 2 as the default version** by running:
    `wsl --set-default-version 2`

4. **Terminal**
    Go to the terminal and open 'ubuntu'.<br>
    For a deeper look into it, google [WSL install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
